# Brokkr
An experimental discord bot written in Python. A constant work in progress...
    Brokkr is a testing ground and learning space for the discord.py API. Feel free to use the code contained for you own personal
    experimenation and learning. Several examples have been pulled from the discord.py example bots as well as other places 
    scattered throughout the web. Most emphasis of this bot will be centered around VM repository management. Let me know what you
    think or if you have any questions!
